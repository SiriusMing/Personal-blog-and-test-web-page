			<p><strong>For me, the world of anime and manga is more than just entertainment. </strong>
        From a young age, I gradually immersed myself in it by casually browsing online. </p>
			<p>Over time, I discovered its fascinating aspects. In this two-dimensional world, the girls live joyful lives, gazing under cherry blossom trees, 
        frolicking by the sea, setting off fireworks at festivals, and forming bands to sing in their school. This is the essence of youth.</p>

          <p><em> Moreover, it has taught me many valuable lessons about love, friendship, and family. 
            I deeply cherish everything about this world.</em></p>

            <p>Why do I love everything about it so much? Perhaps it's the inherent charm. Whether it's the stories or the entire experience, there's something captivating about it. 
              Take "Blue Archive," which I've mentioned many times on my personal website, as an example. </p>
            <p>The students in it are all full of personalityâ€”some are shy and bashful, some are tsundere, some embody the Yamato Nadeshiko ideal, and others have mischievous little devil traits. 
              Their personalities, identities, and appearances are all unique, yet they all feel so vibrant and alive. 
              <strong>It's as if their joys and sorrows are right beside us, providing us with spiritual companionship.</strong></p>
