            <h3>A story with the song: Old Fashion</h3>
            <p>
              As the melody of "Old Fashion" by Back Number fills the room, a wave of nostalgia washes over me, carrying me back to simpler times. 
              <br>
              I can't help but feel a pang of longing for the carefree days of my youth, when the biggest worry on my mind was completing my homework on time or deciding what to do with my friends on the weekends. 
              Back then, the future seemed so distant, filled with endless possibilities waiting to be explored.<br>
              <strong>"Old Fashion" serves as a poignant reminder to cherish these moments, to hold onto them tightly as they slip through my fingers like grains of sand. For even as time marches relentlessly forward, 
              these memories will remain etched in my heart, a testament to the beauty of youth and the fleeting nature of time.</strong></p>
